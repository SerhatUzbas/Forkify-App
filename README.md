# Forkify-App

This project includes MVC architecture, OOP, third party APÄ° and more.

Working with Javascript modules exceeded my expectations actually.Project demonstrates with vanilla JS, small scale project can be easily written without any framework like React.

State control with vanilla JS is actually bit of harder than frameworks. But in small scale project, it can be easily implemented and my opinion is this is a better aprroach to finish project.

Async JS is used a lot in the project. Using modern async JS (async-await or top level await) instead of XML or (then chain) was pleasurable and instructive. 

MVC architecture allows you render data that is fetched from third party API and add lot of functionality.

Codes are written by me, but the project is not belongs to me.

This is Jonas Schmedtmann's project which is created for learning purposes.
